The goal was to train a model to accurately categorize unseen quotes as belonging to one show or the other.\nThe Adventure Begins\u0026hellip; Every good quest starts with assembling a crew. I needed to gather a dataset of quotes from the two shows. This required venturing out into the wilderness of the internet to scrape relevant quotes from fan sites using selenium and beautifulSoup.\nAfter gathering over 100 quotes from each show, it was time to wrangle the unruly data into a form suitable for ML models. I cleaned and preprocessed the quotes, adding labels to denote the source show. python\nquotes['label'] = 0 # Star Wars quotes['label'] = 1 # Friends Training Time Now for the fun part - teaching a model to discern quote origins! I turned to the mighty BERT architecture and leveraged a pretrained model. BERT has oozed NLP knowledge from consuming piles of text data. I just needed to fine-tune it with my quotes.\nFirst, I had to encode the text into numeric tokens that BERT digests:\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased') encoded_quotes = tokenizer(quotes, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='tf') Then I compiled a BERT model, fitted it on the training quotes, and evaluated it on a held-out test set.\nThe Journey\u0026rsquo;s End After fine-tuning the BERT model on the quote dataset, it was time to evaluate its performance and see how well it learned to classify the quotes. I tested the model on a held-out set of 40 quotes that it had never seen before - 20 Star Wars and 20 Friends. This would give an unbiased estimate of its real-world accuracy. The model achieved an overall test accuracy of 80%! This exceeded my expectations considering the small dataset size. Digging deeper into the results:\nPrecision for Star Wars quotes was 82% and Friends 78% Recall for Star Wars was 85% and Friends 75% The confusion matrix showed the model struggled slightly more with Friends quotes - mistaking 5 of them for Star Wars. This may be because Star Wars quotes have more distinct language like \u0026ldquo;Use the force\u0026rdquo; and mentions of \u0026ldquo;Jedi\u0026rdquo;. Whereas Friends has more everyday conversational quotes that are harder to classify.\nOverall though, BERT was successfully able to learn distinguishing features between the two classes with moderate success.\nThere is definitely scope to improve accuracy further with:\nA larger dataset for better generalization Trying different pretrained models like RoBERTa Hyperparameter tuning - learning rate, epochs etc. Regularization techniques like dropout to reduce overfitting But as a first attempt, I am pleased with the model\u0026rsquo;s capabilities. It can classify unseen quotes with 80% accuracy - not bad! This was a fun first adventure in training BERT for text classification. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to keep exploring how transformers can be applied to NLP tasks going forward.\nUntil next time, may the force be with you!\n","date":1701993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701993600,"objectID":"f33452a2b8b963a83a6086946c77b16e","permalink":"https://gaurichaudhari9.github.io/project/classifying-tv-show-quotes-with-bert.html","publishdate":"2023-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/classifying-tv-show-quotes-with-bert.html","section":"project","summary":"Leveraged BERT's NLP power to distinguish sci-fi from sitcom","tags":["NLP"],"title":"Classifying TV Show Quotes using BERT","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Educational"],"content":" As I finished writing the final draft of my first first author paper, survClust, there were a lot of other firsts! In my opinion writing the methods and a crisp conclusion and discussion were the difficult parts.\nBelow, I share my notes that really came in handy while I was writing the methods section of my manuscript.\nWhat this is? Notes on how to describe a statistical methodology. Some basic rules and notations that you should keep in mind.\nScientific notations Random variables are usually written in uppercase roman letters: \\(X,Y\\), etc.\nProbability density functions (pdfs) and probability mass functions are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g. \\(f_{(x)}\\), or \\(f_{X}(x)\\).\nCumulative distribution functions (cdfs) are denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. \\(F(x)\\), or \\(F_{X}(x)\\).\nLet's summarize the above three points with an example -\nA random variable \\(X\\) has density \\(f_{X}\\) as follows -\n\\[ Pr[a\\leq X\\leq b]=\\int _{a}^{b}f_{X}(x)\\,dx\\]\nHence, if \\(F_{X}\\) is the cumulative distribution function of \\(X\\) then:\n\\[F_{X}(x)=\\int _{-\\infty }^{x}f_{X}(u)\\,du,\\]\nand\n\\[f_{X}(x)={\\frac {d}{dx}}F_{X}(x).\\]\nNow, let's go over some quick statistical nitty-gritties:\nGreek letters \\(\\theta, \\beta\\) are commonly used to denote unknown parameters.\nPlacing a hat, or caret, over a true parameter denotes an estimator of it, e.g., \\(\\widehat {\\theta }\\) is an estimator for \\(\\theta\\) .\nBuilding on the above point the sample mean, variance and correlation coefficient are denoted as \\(\\bar{x}, s^2, r\\) respectively. On the other hand population parameters are represented as follows - population mean \\(\\mu\\), population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), and population correlation as \\(\\rho\\)\nFinally most of the time you will need to know the following writing notions while drafting the methods section of your manuscript -\nInput or independent variables are denoted by \\(X\\), output or dependent variables are denoted by \\(Y\\), and qualitative outputs by \\(G\\).\nIf \\(X\\) is a vector, annotate its values by subscripts \\(X_j\\)\nObserved values are written in lowercase; hence the \\(i^{th}\\) observed value of \\(X\\) is written as \\(x_i\\), where \\(x_i\\) is a scalar or vector.\nMatrices are represented by bold uppercase letters; for example a matrix \\(\\textbf{X}\\), with dimensions \\(N\\) x \\(p\\) i.e a set of \\(N\\) input \\(p\\)-vectors. In general, vectors will not be bold, except when they have \\(N\\) components; Note that all vectors are assumed to be column vectors.\nLet's break it down with an example -\nGiven a vector of inputs \\(\\textbf{X}^T = (X_1,X_2,...,X_p)\\), we predict the output \\(\\textbf{Y}\\) via a simple linear regression -\n\\[\\hat{\\textbf{Y}} = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{p} \\textbf{X}_{j}\\hat\\beta_{j}\\] Or writing this in a vector form as an inner product - \\(\\hat{\\textbf{Y}} = \\textbf{X}^T\\hat\\beta\\) To solve this we need to estimate a value of \\(\\beta\\) such that it minimizes the Residual Sum of Squares or RSS as follows -\n\\[RSS(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - x_{i}^T\\beta)^2\\]\nOr in matrix notation we can write it as,\n\\[RSS(\\beta) = (\\textbf{y} - \\textbf{X}\\beta)^T(\\textbf{y} - \\textbf{X}\\beta)\\] where \\(\\textbf{X}\\) is an \\(N × p\\) matrix with each row an input vector, and \\(\\textbf{y}\\) is an \\(N\\)-vector of the outputs. See how \\(\\textbf{y}\\) is in bold in the above question.\nOr take one of your favorite papers, and try to go over its methods section to iron and figure out other key details!\n","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"aec2c8f71885ed500802dc6fb07861b2","permalink":"https://gaurichaudhari9.github.io/post/2020-12-01-primer-scientific.html","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-12-01-primer-scientific.html","section":"post","summary":"As I finished writing the final draft of my first first author paper, survClust, there were a lot of other firsts!

This poses an interesting challenge as in to understand heterogeneity in a population by not unsupervised clustering followed by hypothesis testing, but in a more targeted fashion where the cluster solutions are more meaningful and driven by outcome of interest\nMOSAIC, or Multi Omic Supervised Integrative Clustering, is a supervised clustering algorithm, inspired from survClust. The primary advantage of such a supervised or weighted approach is that the final clusters are robust and more meaningful in terms of outcome of interest. Our approach downplays the unrelated features and only keeps the contribution from associated features, making it resistant to noise from other data trends. It also provides a novel approach to deal with samples that have missing data across data types, where in most cases the analysis would be reduced to samples with complete data.

Generally you need to buy a domain to host web pages, but with Netlify you can use their web hosting service, with their domain and be live on the internet! It is free, however you can choose your own subdomain.\nSetting up on Netlify is super easy -\nlog in to Netlify via GitHub and select the repository where you have all the website files Netlify deployment works on both private and public repositories Set up the HUGO_VERSION accordingly. Check the version you are using in Rstudio via blogdown::hugo_version() command.\nOnce you deploy, Netlify will assign a random subdomain ending in netlify.app or netlify.com, for instance I got infallible-poitras-1234-netlify.app\nThe IMPORTANT bit, after you have deployed your website on Netlify, change the baseurl parameter in config.toml\nYou can change the subdomain and keep the netlify.app. Or you can apply for a rbind.io domain name. Just open an issue on their GitHub repository, and fill their template form. They are quick and will get back to you soon! Now, everytime you commit to GitHub, Netlify will trigger a deploy. However, you can change this automatic trigger. ALSO, remember to run blogdown::build_site() before each commit, as this updates the public folder, which is used by Netlify to publish.\nFor step by step instructions to Netlify, check this post here\nPsst.. what do you mean by domain and subdomain\nRedirects To redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPs, use a redirects file. I placed a file called _redirects here -\nstatic |=== _redirects It contains this -\nhttp://arorarshi.rbind.io/* https://arorarshi.rbind.io/:splat 301!\nAlso explained here\nNow moving on to the cool stuff with customization!😎\nCustomizations Favicon A favicon is a website icon or a tab icon on the left hand side in a tab. For example mine is a sun :). To get one for yourself, just select favicon image of your choice and place it here -\nassets |=== images |=== filename.png Color and Fonts Academic template is really good and it already comes with great inbuilt themes like - Apogee, Minimal, Forest, Rose etc. Themes can be specified here -\nconfig |=== params.toml with the variable theme\nIf you want to create your own color and font template, use any of the the existing themes and open the file here -\nthemes |=== hugo-academic |=== data |=== themes Each theme has its own .toml file.\nThe colors are specified as HTML codes for Primary, Menu sections and so on. I used this to pick colors!\nTowards the end of the .toml file, there will be a font parameter. Font .toml files are present here -\nthemes |=== hugo-academic |=== data |=== fonts I used Google fonts and you can specify them as they appear in their web address.

Whether its your work, skills, or other hobbies, they all can reach the light of day in one platform!\nI will go over building websites via blogdown with Hugo’s Acadmeic theme as a template. Though Yihui’s blogdown tutorial is the ultimate Holy Grail. I wanted to write a simple tutorial about getting started with a quick and easy website without getting overwhelmed :)\n0. Getting Started By running the following commands in R:\n#set up install.packages(\u0026#39;blogdown\u0026#39;) library(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;) blogdown::install_hugo() #start creating a website by new_site()! blogdown::new_site(theme = \u0026quot;gcushen/hugo-academic\u0026quot;) #I have passed the academic theme above #view your website locally blogdown::build_site() OK. This created a bunch of files in your directory, and created a static website, something like this\nThis is an exhaustive overview of how the Academic template looks like. We don’t need all of these functionalities, and we can only retain what we like.\nIf you mess up something, original GitHub code is available here for your reference.\n1. What’s going on? A lot!\nFirst place I would recommend trying is getting familiar with .md files present here your website folder \u0026gt; content \u0026gt; home\nWe are looking at this\nEach .md file here is a functionality/widget of the Academic theme. For example, if you see the skills section of the website has icons in rows, experience section is in a bullet-timeline format, and so on. They are all controlled by the files here, and are displayed by logical active=true/false as follows-\n# About widget. widget = \u0026quot;about\u0026quot; # See https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/ headless = true # This file represents a page section. active = true # Activate this widget? true/false # If active=FALSE widget is suppressed and displayed if TRUE. Start by turning everything FALSE except -\nabout.md skills.md experience.md Also, note the weight section in the .md script. This is the order in which widgets will get displayed on your website. For example, the bubbles image background at the very top has weight=1 as seen in slider.md.\n2. Getting the hang of it? After turning off all the widgets, except about.md, skills.md and experience.md (you don’t have to delete others, and might want to store them for later). You will have the bare bones of your website.\nNow start filling in some details. The about.md file points to content -\u0026gt; authors -\u0026gt; admin -\u0026gt; _index.md file, from where it stores and displays all that information. Fill it up with your own deets!\nSame goes for skills.md and eperience.md\n3. config.toml and config folder I use config.toml for all my settings, and as the name says config details. Remaining stuff like menu details go to config -\u0026gt; _default -\u0026gt; menus.toml, and params.toml for all website settings like theme, color, and other settings. (You won’t need a lot to start with)\nmenus.toml This is the easy part! This just contains the menu buttons you want to see at the top of your website. Though everything is published on your website in a long-ish format. Here, the menu buttons at the top will help the viewer to navigate to key sections. Use the widgets you want to appear here like follows:\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Projects\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#projects\u0026quot; weight = 30 [[main]] name = \u0026quot;Posts\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#posts\u0026quot; weight = 40 # and so on In my website about and skills are at weight 10 and 20, and that’s why projects has weight 30. Menu items follow the same order and weights as the widgets as well. You can change that! Weights just determine the order of appearance in the menu section.\nconfig.toml Here, I have everything as default except-\nbaseurl = \u0026quot;https://arorarshi.rbind.io/\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;Arshi Arora\u0026quot; copyright = paginate = 10 # Number of items per page in paginated lists. enableEmoji = true sharing = true #fixing image in posts #this just puts the image used in your rmarkdown posts to appropriate folder, so that it doesn\u0026#39;t appear broken on website. confused? you can skip for now. uglyurls = true #[permalinks] # post = \u0026quot;/:year/:month/:day/:slug/\u0026quot; [blackfriday] bit #this is only needed for .md files. Pandoc is better for .Rmd. Maybe remove later but for now I have it in. params.toml For a basic setup, you don’t need to worry about this.\n4.

In order to consider clinical outcomes (such as treatment response and survival) simultaneously in tumor classification, we developed a new algorithm called SurvClust for supervised clustering. The algorithm learns a weighted distance matrix from each molecular data type with effect sizes as weights. To facilitate integration, quantile normalization is utilized to standardize the distance vectors. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is then used to map the subjects into an n-dimensional space that preserves between-subject distances for clustering. Application to the TCGA pan-cancer datasets revealed survival associations driven by mutation burden and specific mutation and co- mutation patterns of cancer driving genes. We will further demonstrate SurvClust’s utility by integrating treatment responses and toxicity profiles in immunotherapy-treated lung, melanoma, and bladder cancer cohorts.\n","date":1538006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538006400,"objectID":"67ff4f2e8a12a68beda395c42464237c","permalink":"https://gaurichaudhari9.github.io/talk/tcga_symposium_2018.html","publishdate":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/tcga_symposium_2018.html","section":"talk","summary":"A sneakpeak of survClust methodology at the TCGA symposium in form of poster","tags":[],"title":"survClust poster TCGA Legacy: Multi-Omics studies in cancer  (2018)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Gauri Chaudhari","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
